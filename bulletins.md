Each week's bulletin is uploaded, usually Saturday night or Sunday morning.
You can download your copy by [Clicking Here.](https://repleatur.net/bulletins/parrafssp.pdf)

### Additional Handout

Pick up your [Invitation to the Chaplaincy Feast Day](https://repleatur.net/bulletins/ChaplaincyFeastDay-Invite.pdf)

I hope this can be the digital equivalent of picking up last week's bulletin from the virtual church's foyer (or narthex)
