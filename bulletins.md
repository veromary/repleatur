Special handout: [**Forty Hours Devotion**](https://repleatur.net/bulletins/40hoursDevotion.pdf) taking place 10-12 September at Girraween.

Each week's bulletin is uploaded, usually Saturday night or Sunday morning.
You can download your copy by [Clicking Here.](https://repleatur.net/bulletins/parrafssp.pdf)

I hope this can be the digital equivalent of picking up last week's bulletin from the virtual church's foyer (or narthex)
