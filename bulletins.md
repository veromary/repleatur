[The Bulletin](http://repleatur.net/bulletins/parrafssp.pdf)

Each week's bulletin is uploaded, usually Saturday night or Sunday morning.

This is [the bulletin for the Parramatta Apostolate of the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter.](http://repleatur.net/bulletins/parrafssp.pdf)

Hoping to be the digital equivalent of picking up last week's bulletin from the virtual church's foyer (or narthex)
