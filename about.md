The name Repleatur comes from a prayer before choir practice.

That's how we begin choir practice.

This web page focusses on choir stuff for the Parramatta Apostolate of the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter.

Choir practice is generally held on Sundays 12.30pm after the 10.45am Mass at Mulgoa and 4pm 1st and 2nd Sundays at Lawson.
