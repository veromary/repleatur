The name Repleatur comes from a prayer before choir practice.

That's how we begin choir practice.

This web page focusses on choir stuff for the Parramatta Apostolate of the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter.

### Join

Choir practice is generally held on Sundays before 5pm Mass at St Francis Xavier's Wentworth Falls.

Generally, if you can come along to practice an hour before Mass is due to start, then that would be really helpful to us.  A minimum requirement would be an ability to sing the Ordinaries of the Mass.  We usually keep it simple.
