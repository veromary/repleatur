This Mass must have been one we have done in the past.  The music is so familiar.  Maybe we can do all the proper Propers.

* Introit = Miserere mihi Domine 
* Gradual = Timebunt gentes
* Alleluia = Cantate Domino
* Offertory = Domine, in auxilium meum respice
* Communion = Domine, memorabor justitiae tuae solius
