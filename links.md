### Repertoire

[Office of Papal Liturgies](https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/index.htm)

Every now and then I find something I'd like to try.

[Verdelot, Sit Nomen Domini BVenedictum](https://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2014/dec/8/polyphonic-piece-your-choir-has-wanted/) with practice videos

[Kevin Allen's work](https://www.ccwatershed.org/allen) all of it - the motets for 3 voices seem like a good place to start.

[Easy 2-3 part motets, Fr Moreno](https://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview/?pi=nla.mus-vn529891-s2-v) - O Salutaris, Anima Christi, that Adoro Te, - I have to type these up!

[Hugh Henry](https://www.fidelitybooks.com.au/Hugh/) has lots of great stuff.

### Organ sheet music

Adapted from [Nova Organi Harmonia](https://chabanelpsalms.org/introductory_material/Gregorian_organ_accomp/) using [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org) and transposed down for the people who say they can't sing that high.  The little lilypad icon indicates lilypond source files.

[Adoro Te](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/adorote.pdf) or in English [Godhead here in hiding](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/godhead.pdf)

[Sing my tongue](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/singmy.pdf) with people's chant version: [Sing my tongue](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/singmytongue.pdf)

[O salutaris](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/osalutarisnoh.pdf) [OSalutarisNOH.ly](https://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/OSalutarisNOH.ly)

[Conditor alme](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/conditoralme.pdf) [ConditorAlme.ly](https://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ConditorAlme.ly)

[VeniCreator](https://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/VeniCreator.pdf) [VeniCreator.ly](https://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/VeniCreator.ly)

Other:

  * [Soul of my Saviour](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/soul1.pdf)
  * [Firmly I believe](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/properfirmly.pdf) to the tune Omni Die. Usually in Australia it is sung to a tune by Edward Elgar, but this alternative was heard at [Maternal Heart](https://www.maternalheart.org) church, Lewisham. I think it is from the New Westminster Hymnal as there is a similar setting in the Old Westminster Hymnal.
  * [O salutaris](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/osalutariswebbe.pdf) the metric tune by Samuel Webbe.
  * [Firmly I believe](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/firmlychords.pdf) same tune as above but with a simplified left hand with verses alternating between chords and the bass voice. If that sounds confusing, see for yourself.
  * [Praise to the Lord](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/praisetothelord.pdf)
  * [Hail Queen of Heaven](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/hailqueen.pdf)
  * [Glory be to Jesus](https://hymni.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/glorybeme.pdf) the left hand had some spans of over an octave so I've transposed the bass line from the original to make it easier to play.


The lilypond source files can be downloaded from [Draft Traditional Hymnbook](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dthymnbook/) at Sourceforge.
