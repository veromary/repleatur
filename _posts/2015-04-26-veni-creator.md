Looking ahead to Pentecost, anyone up for joining us at Mulgoa for 24th May?

There's a lovely, simple [Veni Creator](http://musique.liturgique.free.fr/partitions/Veni%20Creator%20-%20Chanoine%20COUTURIER%20-%202p.pdf) that we used to sing at the Holy Family Religion School at Riverwood with the kids.  The verses alternate between the Gregorian Chant and a 4 part setting.

Apart from that, it's still Mass 1, Credo 1, plus there's a Sequence - Veni Sancte Spiritus.

Pentecost is the Birthday of the Church.  It's a big feast day up there with Easter, Epiphany and Christmas.  You could even argue that it's bigger than Christmas!  It's a great excuse to pull out all the stops and have a party, and you probably don't have quite as much by way of family commitments as you do with Christmas and Easter.

Rehearsal schedule is flexible.

Who is with me?
