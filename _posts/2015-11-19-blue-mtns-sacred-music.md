I'm looking towards Christmas with some trepidation.

So, the plan so far:

* Gaudete Sunday at Wentworth Falls
* Midnight Mass at Mulgoa
* Day Mass at Wentworth Falls

It would be good to include some social singing opportunities - last year we visited a nursing home to sing carols with a few young families.  Also just singing for the fun of it - maybe going carolling around the block?

Another idea was to have a weekly rehearsal here in Woodford in the lead up to Christmas.

Need to know who's interested in what and how best to keep in touch.

Happy end of Liturgical Year!
