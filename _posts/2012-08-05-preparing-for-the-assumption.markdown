The plan for the Assumption so far:

Mass 9, Credo 1.

Try doing proper [Introit (Signum magnum)](http://www.chantcafe.com/2010/08/signum-magnum-apparuit-in-caelo.html) and Communion [available at Rene Goupil](http://renegoupil.org).  Back up recordings from [St Benedict's, Sao Paolo, Brazil](http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/trid_in_assumptione_b_m_v.html).

Probably psalm tone the Gradual, Alleluia and Offertory.

Possible Latin Marian chant for motets: Ave maris stella, Virgo Dei Genitrix, good old O Sanctissima, Ave Maria.

We're down a few choir members this time, so if anyone would like to step up I can get you book/CD for practice at home, and going through the music with you is an option too.

Not 100% sure Mulgoa or Girraween, but probably Mulgoa.  Wednesday 15th August, 7pm.
