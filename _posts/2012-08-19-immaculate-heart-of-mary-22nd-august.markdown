![Immaculate Heart](http://catholicismpure.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/maryheart.jpg?w=200)This Wednesday is the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, completing our hattrick of three Sung Masses on adjacent Wednesdays.  All Mass 9, Credo 1.

The feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary is only a second class feast so can't skimp and link to pre-existing material.  The propers are pretty and I hereby renew my determination to get back into the proper propers, but this time there is no time, so psalm tone it is.

The alleluia shares the same tune as the [5th Sunday after Pentcost](http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/trid_dVpostPentecosten.html).

Okay, so you've had a look at the pdf and first up you're staring at the Introit think "that's not a psalm tone".  Well, it's not the proper antiphon either, and I think we can manage it.  Have a listen and see what you think.

[Immac-01]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Immac-01.mp3) Introit
[Immac-02]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Immac-02.mp3) Gradual
[Immac-03]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Immac-03.mp3) Alleluia
[Immac-04]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Immac-04.mp3) Offertory
[Immac-05]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Immac-05.mp3) Communion - this is a beautiful bible verse.

And for an offertory motet we have [Ave Maria]({{ site.url }}/2012/05/18/ave-maria/).  Communion we could try the Magnificat again?  Or remember that silence is always an option :) or Ave Verum - which might be good reminiscent of Mary's sharing in the sufferings of Our Lord (heart pierced...)[Ave Verum on video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdyQQ8I2Pi4).
