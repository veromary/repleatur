Here's the latest draft for tomorrow night's sung Mass:
[test]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/test.pdf)

I'm currently trying to pick a recessional hymn.

[Lord Jesus, think on me](http://cyberhymnal.org/htm/l/o/lojthink.htm) is my top pick right now, but not sure how many people know it.

May this Lenten Discipline, would be my favourite, but it's copyright.

Glory be to Jesus would be a good, well known one. About the same flavour as Lord Jesus think on me.

God of Mercy and Compassion might be a good one - fun to sing.

[Forty Days](http://nethymnal.org/htm/f/o/fortyday.htm) would be perfect, but, again, not so well known (as far as I know...)

I guess Glory be to Jesus is the safest bet, and it's not really a time for learning new stuff.  6pm Sunday night people mostly want to sleep ready for Monday (or maybe that's just  me :))
