We have a sung Mass at Lawson every second Sunday of the month.

10th June this year is the Sunday in the Octave of Corpus Christi or the Second Sunday after Pentecost.  It's the day of the big Procession of the Blessed Sacrament in Sydney and also the Queen's Birthday Long Weekend.

Here is the plan for what the choir will sing: [propers]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/propers2.pdf)

Mass 11, Credo 1, 
proper Offertory (it's an unusually simple one) :
[wpaudio url="http://musicfortheliturgy.org/MP3/EX_P_02Sn_t7_domine_convertere_TRIORS.mp3"] from [Rene Goupil](http://www.renegoupil.org).
Introit to an introit tone, Gradual and Alleluia to psalm tone 2, Communion verse to solemn psalm tone with either extra psalm verses or the chant antiphon [Ave Verum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZrJJTZQKlA).

And I can't make it to sing that day.  So everyone in the congregation must join in the Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus and Agnus Dei.  That's the people's part after all.  The choir is there to lead.
