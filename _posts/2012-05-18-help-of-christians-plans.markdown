The booklet for [this Thursday night](http://repleatur.net/events/mary-help-of-christians/) at [Mulgoa](http://repleatur.net/locations/st-marys-mulgoa/):

[propers](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/propers.pdf)

Mass 9, Credo 2, psalm toned propers, except Ave Maria for Offertory.  A few extra verses here and there for good measure.

The gabc file for the Ave Maria, since I couldn't find it anywhere else:
[avemaria.gabc](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/avemaria.gabc)
Sorry, I didn't put in ictuses (icti?).

See [The Earlier Post](http://repleatur.net/2012/05/18/ave-maria/) for examples of how to sing the Ave Maria as the Gregorian Chant Antiphon (Liber Usualis p 1679)
