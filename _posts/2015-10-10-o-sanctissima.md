title: O Sanctissima

Picking a version of O Sanctissima is a bit like choosing chocolate.  This one takes the harmony from Ludwig von Beethoven and the words from the Mass Book.  The old red books stop at the first two verses - which is probably a wise thing - but my edition has five verses, just in case.

Here's a very pleasant recording with the repeats as Beethoven wrote it.  I took out the repeats in the above, but consider the repeats good for learning.  As far as I can tell the harmony is the same.

The words are probably different.  It's one of those hymns which has lots of various verses.  I can't remember where I pulled these words from, but that's where we're stuck until the next edition of the Mass Books.
