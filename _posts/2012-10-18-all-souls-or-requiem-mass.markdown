All Souls Day[![]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Purgatory-2.jpg)]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Purgatory-2.jpg)

Friday 2nd November
6pm Mass at Mulgoa

(also possible votive requiem 10.30am Monday 5th November at Glenbrook)

It is surprisingly tricky to find recordings.  The **Ordinaries** at least are at [Corpus Christi Watershed](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/).  Look for Mass XVIII (18) Deus Genitor alme with Kyrie B and Agnus Dei B.

NOTE: The ordinaries are the most important thing to learn.  They are for everyone to learn.  So get those three first: Kyrie, Sanctus, Agnus Dei.

The **Propers** are another kettle of fish.  The wonderful collection from [St Benedict's, Sao Paolo](http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/trid_i_c_omnium_fidelium_defunctorum.html) only has the Introit and Offertory.  The Dies Irae (Sequence) can be found [in the Internet Archive](http://archive.org/details/GregorianChantMass) (see track 2 - the first track listed).  I recorded my own take on the Gradual and Tract (Requiem and Absolve): [GradualTract]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GradualTract.mp3).  The recording of Lux Aeterna is more elusive this morning.

Youtube clips are musch easier to find.  [Here is a playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR7cOUX2gl7pz2mniDbYprDfa4RoB-wsA) of propers for a Requiem.  Youtube frowns upon people turning these into mp3s.

The other way is to buy recordings like this: [DEFUNTS (LES) - Messe de Requiem, Liturgie des Saints (Choeur des Moines de l'Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes, Claire)](http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid=1474379) or a cheaper one with a ladies choir: [Ego sum Resurrectio: Gregorian Chant for the Dead](http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid=2731).

So, in conclusion, it looks like there's a real gap in the market for a set of free recordings of the propers for the Mass for the Dead.

And I haven't looked at the psalm toned versions yet, but that's a possibility too.  I guess it makes sense to shorten the Gradual and Tract when you consider the Dies Irae right afterwards.
