Easter Sunday Day Mass at Lawson.

About 10.30am - but I need to check that - I'm going from memory.

[Here are the Brazillian recordings](http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/missa_dominica_resurrectionis.html)

[Here is the sheet music to print](http://www.institute-christ-king.org/uploads/music/MassEasterSun_lg.pdf)

Introit: Resurrexi
Gradual: Haec Dies - great one this - we'll do the proper proper this time
Alleluia: Pascha Nostrum - tempted to psalm tone this one because there's also...
Sequence: Victimae Paschali Laudes - you need to learn this!
Offertory: Terra tremuit
Communion: Pascha nostrum

And Mass 1 - Lux Origo - the Paschaltide Mass.  Credo 1. This is the same as my former post for Divine Mercy Sunday.

And lots of party food after!

So, your order of learning things is:
Mass 1
Credo 1 you know already
Victimae Paschali Laudes - one note per syllable, practically easy.
Introit, Resurrexi

and if you get that far, you are doing brilliantly!

I almost forgot the extras!  Regina Caeli, O Filii et Filiae, Through the Red Sea, Alleluia Sing to Jesus, By your Kingly Power o Risen Lord - what would you like?

I think this warrants booklets for the congregation - what do you think?
