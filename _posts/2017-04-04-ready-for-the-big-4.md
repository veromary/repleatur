"It should be Big 3, surely?"

But Big 4 is a caravan park franchise and I'm doing Easter Sunday Day Mass as well as the usual Triduum, so we'll leave it as Four, OK?

And there's more than the Triduum.

This is what Easter means to me.

Then we're going on "Retreat" for a week.

Then it's theoretically back to school - ha, ha, ha.

I'm dabbling in promoting these to [The Repleatur Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/repleatur).  It seems there's a fair bit of ongoing care and feeding to actually make a facebook page work.  Getting a posse of dedicated people to keep visiting the page and liking everything might help.

I'm sure there were other things to add.
