title: Clap your hands!
---

July's Sung Mass at Wentworth Falls starts with the cry **All peoples clap your hands!**

How about we go with last month's plan and practise this Sunday at Lawson 4pm in the meeting room.  Then for the actual day we can meet at Wentworth Falls 3.30pm to practise before Mass at 5pm.
