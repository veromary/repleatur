For an update on simpler polyphonic pieces.

### SAB

[Panis Angelicus](http://www0.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Panis_angelicus_a_3_(Claudio_Casciolini)) Casciolini or Baini - this is the modernish one. Greg's choir has an older one.

[Jesu Rex Admirabilis](http://www0.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Jesu_Rex_admirabilis_(Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina)) Palestrina - this is an awesome, must have piece for every choir

[Ametur](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2015/jun/1/easy-3-part-motet-sacred-heart-jesus/) - easy 3 part motet in honour of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Australian MSC priest.

[O Sanctissima](http://www3.cpdl.org/wiki/images/6/61/O_sanctissima.pdf) 3 part arrangement attributed to Beethoven

### Canons (also known as Rounds)

[Tantum Ergo]({{ site.url }}/pdf/motets/tantumergo-dp.pdf) The one Fr Popplewell wrote and taught at the legendary BXVI Homeschool Camp of 2017.

[Jubilate](http://www.brandt.id.au/newbookoldhymns/hymns/jubilatedeo.html) Attributed to Michael Praetorius

[Non nobis Domine](http://www.brandt.id.au/newbookoldhymns/hymns/nonnobis.html) This is the one I learned before the better known and very similar [Da Pacem Domine](http://www.brandt.id.au/newbookoldhymns/hymns/dapacem.html).

[Magnificat]({{ site.url }}/pdf/motets/magnificat-cf.pdf) - transcribed from students memories

### Other stuff I haven't tried yet

I keep coming across so many more pieces that I'd love to try one day, so I'll add these ones in here for the future.

[Ravanello's 3 part motets](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2013/mar/19/ravanello-polyphonic-motets/) written for small choirs

[Kevin Allen's 3 part motets](http://www.ccwatershed.org/motecta/) (I bought the book from Lulu - 3 copies, but there's a hurdle learning new stuff, even though this link has practice recordings)

[Morales Alleluia](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2015/apr/24/polyphonic-alleluia-3-voices-cristobal-de-morales/)

Richard Dering was a composer in the court of King Charles and he wrote [Cantica Sacra](http://imslp.org/wiki/Cantica_sacra_I_(Dering%2C_Richard)) for 2 and 3 voices with Basso Continuo. I'm in the process of getting my head around what Basso Continuo means - I get the impression it's the base for an organ improv accompaniment thing. Anyway, this could be a source of more pieces.
