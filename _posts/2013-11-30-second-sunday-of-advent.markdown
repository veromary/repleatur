It's also the feast of the Immaculate Conception, <del>but I think that gets transferred this year.</del>  

Propers for Immaculate Conception:

[introit]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/introit.pdf)

[gradalle]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gradalle.pdf)

[offcomm]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/offcomm.pdf)

So those there above things are what I think we'll be singing.  Below is what we're probably not singing.  You got that?

Here are the psalm toned propers for the second Sunday of Advent: [Advent2]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Advent2.pdf)  I put the offertory before the gradual to get a better page break.  I print them single sided and cut them up to go into folders for the choir.

PS: this is for the Mass at Lawson 5pm, Sunday 8th December.  I (Veronica) can't make it that day, but we'll still practise tomorrow (1st December 4pm) and see how we go.
