Gearing up for **Christmas!!!**

A quick refresher on the Ordinaries we have planned: **Mass 8**
or **Missa de Angelis** and **Credo 3**

Easiest way is for me to point you to the [CCWatershed's Kyriale Page](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/) which has videos, pdfs, mp3s for all the Masses and Credos, just need to scroll along to the right ones.

Otherwise, here is a rather beautiful video with Kyrie and Gloria, (then some fragment of something else) Sanctus (a Great Amen to the tune of the Sanctus??) and Agnus Dei, Ite missa est/Deo gratias.

Then all you need is Credo 3 (which I have had fun playing on the piano, so hopefully will be able to accompany it on the night/day)

I think that should do it.

God bless you, especially for this last dash end of Advent!
