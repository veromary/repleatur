Here are my attempts at the Introit and the Alleluia for the feast of the Dedication of the Basilica of St Michael the Archangel for this Sunday.

**Introit** - Benedicite Dominum, omnes angeli ejus...
[audio mp3="{{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/introit.mp3"][/audio]

**Alleluia** - just the Alleluia, then the end bit of the verse and the final alleluia.

I would have the Offertory and Communion, but still need more practice before I can sing them through.  No, I don't just sing straight off the page.
