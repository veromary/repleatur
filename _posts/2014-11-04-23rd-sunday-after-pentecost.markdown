We've hit the end of the Liturgical year!

Hoping for a sung Mass at Mulgoa.  Sunday 16th November, 10.45am, practice from 9.30am, St Mary's, Mulgoa.

Get your propers at [ccwatershed's Rene Goupil page](http://www.ccwatershed.org/goupil/) - scroll right down to the bottom then up one.

23rd Sunday after Pentecost - the music may sound familiar as it repeats for all the Sundays from 23rd to however many are left at the end of the year.

[Ora pro nobiZ](http://oraprono.biz) is my attempt at a separate social media sort of thing.  Theoretically it should be a way to delegate some of the organizing that goes into these things.  Maybe even get some more music going.

Dicit Dominus - Thus sayeth the Lord, I think thoughts of peace, not of affliction

And the brilliant Communio - Amen dico vobis - Amen I say to you...
