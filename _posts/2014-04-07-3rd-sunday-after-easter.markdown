Next Sung Mass at Lawson:

Sunday 11th May
3rd Sunday after Easter (4th Sunday of Easter in the new calendar)

Mass 1 - recordings at [St Antoine Daniel Kyriale](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/)

Credo 1 (bottom of the page above)

Propers - Jubilate Deo - at least the first Alleluia - [St Rene Goupil Gregorian Chant](http://www.ccwatershed.org/goupil/)

Possible fun piece, if we can do it beautifully:
