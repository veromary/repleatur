![Trailer Mass on the Christus Rex Pilgrimage]({{ site.url }}/images/trailermass.jpg)

Just when we're starting to get the hang of having Thursday night choir practice, a few big trips come up! Here are the plans for while we're a bit short. It was great to put our heads together to come up with this plan.

### 18th Sunday after Pentecost

Sunday 13th October

Low Mass

 * Immaculate Mary
 * Ave Verum
 * Jesus My Lord, My God, My All
 * Help of Christians

### 19th Sunday after Pentecost

20th October

Sung Mass

 * Ave Verum
 * Adoro Te Devote
 * Hail Queen of Heaven

### Christus Rex (Christ the King)

27th October

Low Mass

 * Crown Him with Many Crowns
 * O King of Might and Splendour
 * Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence
 * Hail Redeemer

### 21st Sunday after Pentecost

3rd November

Low Mass (unless we get more servers and maybe someone to sing the Propers along with Patrick)

 * Help Lord the Souls which Thou hast Made
 * God of Mercy and Compassion
 * Jesus My Lord, My God, My All
 * The Lord's My Shepherd

Then next choir practice should happen the 7th November 7pm. See you then!
