Sunday, February 8th, practice 4pm, Mass 5pm.

Proper propers - see [CCWatershed's St. Rene Goupil Gregorian Chant page](http://www.ccwatershed.org/goupil/)
or the Monastery of St Benedict, Sao Paolo, Brazil has a page [just for Sexagesima](http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/trid_sexagesima.html)

Mass 17 - the one for Sundays of Advent and Lent, even though it's not quite Lent yet, we can use it in March too.
Find recordings at [St Daniel Antoine Kyriale](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/) or the [Kyriale from Brazil](http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/kyriale_eng.html).  There are a few options for the Kyrie - we are going with (A).

Thinking of singing Pange Lingua for an extra for Communion.


It's in the yellow books, and also features prominantly in [a book I reviewed briefly here](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2015/jan/31/lord-world/).

I hope that helps.
