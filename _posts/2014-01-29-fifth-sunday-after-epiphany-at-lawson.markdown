After a refreshing holiday we're jumping back into a simple sung Mass at Lawson with the Fifth Sunday after Epiphany.  This is a time of year when the propers repeat, though they don't have much chance with Candlemas falling on this Sunday.

Here are the psalm toned propers: [gregorio52e8d129c56898.35437105]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gregorio52e8d129c56898.35437105.pdf)

Practice this Sunday 2nd February, 4pm and next Sunday 9th February 4pm, for Mass next Sunday 9th February at 5pm.
