### Free Gregorian Chant Workshop

Again we're offering a short 1 hour workshop in Gregorian Chant.  There are a number of options available depending on your experience with reading music and singing.  [Contact me]({{ site.url }}/contact/) for more details.

The agenda, depending on ability, ranges from the easier hymns:

 * Veni Creator
 * Adoro te devote

a revision of the Sunday ordinaries from Missa Orbis Factor and Credo 1

 * Kyrie
 * Gloria
 * Sanctus
 * Agnus Dei

to the propers for the following Sunday:

 * **Suscepimus, Deus** - a typical mode 1 introit - a great intro to chant
 * **Gustate et videte** - taste and see - a mode 3 communion antiphon
 * A mode 7 **Alleluia** - the day's one is not familiar to me, so might substitute a known tune to make things easier.
 * **Populum humilem** - the offertory antiphon for the day - same mode as the well known simple Salve Regina so has a familiar sound.

### Looking ahead

With a new baby on the horizon, it's worth mapping out the upcoming second Sundays of the month to give some idea of what to expect.

 * **July 10** : 8th Sunday Post Pentecost (propers outlined above)
 * **August 14** : 13th Sunday Post Pentecost
 * **September 11** : 17th Sunday Post Pentecost
 * **October 1** : Saturday, wedding of Jessica and Gerard Smith at Rouse Hill. Low Mass with hymns. They have requested Veni Creator (the [Couturier](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2016/may/14/veni-creator-chant-plus-polyphony-couturier/) one if possible) and Adoro Te.
 * **October 9** : 21st Sunday Post Pentecost
 * **November 13** : 26th (2nd last) Sunday Post Pentecost - the last few Sundays of the year all use the same propers (_Dicit Dominus_), so this should be easier
 * **December 11** : Gaudete Sunday! (aka 3rd Sunday of Advent) - we should know this one.
 * **December 25** falls on a Sunday this year - we usually have a midnight Mass somewhere - I remember last year at Mulgoa singing by candle-light.  Very beautiful but a little challenging on the technical side.

The baby is due early September, so looking for ways to simplify Masses around that time.
