First post with new website set up - I hope this works!

Just to reconfirm plans for next Sunday:

**Daylight Savings Ends** = we get more sleep

The regular parish Mass is for 8am with refreshments afterwards.

We hope to start practice at 9.30am. Then at 10:30am:

 * First up, a Gelineau Psalm as Fr P processes in.
 * Then Vidi Aquam.
 * Then Introit
 * Kyrie 1
 * Gloria 1
 * Epistle
 * Haec Dies, Alleluia then Victimae Paschali Laudes.
 * Gospel
 * Credo 1
 * Offertory
 * O Filii et Filiae
 * Sanctus 1
 * Agnus Dei 1
 * Communion with verses
 * Ite Missa Est / Deo Gratias with double Alleluias
 * Through the Red Sea by R A Knox in the Living Parish Hymnbook

Please let me know if there's anything I've forgotten.

I'll have a go at doing booklets for the congregation - I have no idea what numbers to expect.

Being a day time Mass I'm hoping there's time to hang around afterwards too!  Maybe I'll be organised enough to bring a plate.

Until then, have a Holy Week.
