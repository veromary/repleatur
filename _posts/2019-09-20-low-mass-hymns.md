Last night at Choir Practice we settled on the following for Mass:

* All Creatures of Our God and King - [orchestral version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAXv8mGM4cQ) - [kiddy version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gx5aYG28sg) - [straight version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3kxfFe3mKY)
* Dona Nobis Pacem - [orchestral version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSdGW_HBrLE) - [impromptu Camp Newfound version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69VG0YuZTHU)
* Soul of my Saviour - [orchestral version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j9ilIUyuqc) - [choir and organ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdFNZfGpSs)
* Hail Queen of Heaven - [Choir and organ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD7bbiyTcNo)

Also, as next week there's the Family Gathering at Doonside, I won't be at Mass, so here are the default hymns. If anyone would like to lead the hymns, please let us know so the current hymn-starter can relax.

* Hail Redeemer - [choir and organ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6JiKWQyAx8) - [bigger choir + organ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xF4dlp36Qw)
* Receive O Father God of Might - don't have recordings with the words, but the tune is Tallis Canon, which is ubiquitous - [Choir and organ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Okg1G-Lpn4) - [Libera's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMNMKxOyGq8) - Libera is an interesting band which combines boy soprano repertoire with a modern World Music feel.
* Soul of my Saviour - [orchestral version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j9ilIUyuqc) - [choir and organ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdFNZfGpSs)
* Hail Queen of Heaven - [Choir and organ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD7bbiyTcNo)

Yes, the last two hymns are the same. Don't worry, the next Sunday will be a Sung Mass and I'll choose something different.
