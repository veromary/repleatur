End of the Liturgical Year!

All the remaining Sundays from here on in use the same Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Offertory and Communion.

Lawson Sung Mass 11th November

Mulgoa Sung Mass 18th November

and here are the propers arranged for the choir at Lawson:
[propers]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/propers.pdf)

At Mulgoa we are a little more ambitious, so probably use the Gradual and Alleluia from the Liber Brevior:
[![The Gradual and Alleluia for the 23rd Sunday After Pentecost from the Liber Brevior]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gradalle-150x150.gif)]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gradalle.gif)  Look at the juxtaposition of "Out of the depths I have cried unto Thee" with "Alleluia".  The difference between the propers.pdf above and this page of the Liber Brevior is the Alleluia.  The Liber Brevior uses the real Alleluia and a psalm tone for the verse.  You might recognise the Alleluia from other Masses over the year.

Again, [the monastery recordings from Brazil](http://www.christusrex.org/www2/cantgreg/trid_dXXIIIpostPentecosten.html) have recordings for all the proper propers.  [Rene Goupil](http://www.renegoupil.org) has recordings of most of them, but they use a different version of the Gradual and Alleluia.

The other mad idea is to have a sung Mass every Sunday, starting with psalm tones and learning a bit more each week.

And the other things to learn more about : Compline and Advent and Christmas.  Learning Alma Redemptoris Mater would help with all three.

Having trouble finding a solemn tone video.  [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2F-ut_MU6E) has the right music, but [this one sounds better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcowATvgOzo) to my ear.

[Palestrina's polyphonic version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWq-SdmNMmA)

And I'll finish with a clip from Brother Alphonsus Mary with a hymn for the holy souls in purgatory: [Help, Lord, the souls that Thou hast made](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7iyY1n__qI), words by Bl Cardinal Newman.
