Happy New Year too!

For January we have the happy coincidence of the Epiphany and the First Friday of the month - double cause for a sung Mass at Mulgoa.

The following Sunday is the second Sunday of the month, so another Sung Mass.  The Sunday in the Octave of the Epiphany is the Feast of the Holy Family in the 1962 books.

I'm hoping to be more organised this year (am I always saying that?) so hopefully build up more capable choristers and be able to sit back maybe.

All the best

Veronica
