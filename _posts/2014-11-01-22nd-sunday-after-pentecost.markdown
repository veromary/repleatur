UPDATE: the feast of the Dedication of the Lateran Basilica trumps the regular sunday, so I am uploading new propers [here]({{ site.url }}/2014/11/08/oops-quick-change-the-propers/).

We aim for a sung Mass on the second Sunday of each month at Lawson.

Last month we sang Mass 8, Missa de Angelis for a change.  We were thinking of continuing with this up to Christmas.
