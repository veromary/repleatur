title: Update for this Sunday Mulgoa and Lawson
---

So, let's start at the beginning.

This Sunday is the 7th of June.

At Mulgoa we will have a Sung Mass of Corpus Christi, [because Pope Leo XIII said it should be an External Solemnity](http://wdtprs.com/blog/2013/06/external-tlm-observance-of-corpus-christi-on-sunday-yes-no/).  So, that means including [Lauda Sion](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2015/jun/2/lauda-sion-translation-robert-southwell-recording/).  Which is wonderful - it is an awesome hymn, even if it is 24 verses long.

Then after Mass we hang around for a big picnic ready for the Eucharistic Procession at 1pm.

The suggestion has been made that girls might like to wear white dresses and strew petals before the Blessed Sacrament.

###Then at Lawson...

Then there is choir practice at Lawson - that's right, Lawson - 3.30pm-4.30pm in the meeting room to allow time for those who wish to attend Mass to travel to Wentworth Falls for the regular Latin Mass at 5pm.

We are practising for Sunday the 14th of June, 3rd Sunday after Pentecost or Sunday in the Octave of the Feast of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus.

There are the regular propers, as well as possible extras such as the ultra simple "Cor Jesu Sacratissimum, miserere nobis" and the 3 part motet [Ametur](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2015/jun/1/easy-3-part-motet-sacred-heart-jesus/).  Ave Verum would fit well too.  And Hail Redeemer would be awesome to finish with.

So, busy Sunday!
