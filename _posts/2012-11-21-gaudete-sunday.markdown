Sunday 16th December
10.45am St Mary's
Mulgoa.

We almost got to sing this one last year.  Let's hope things come together better this year.

The plan so far:



	
  * Proper Introit and Communion.

	
  * Gradual and Alleluia as per Liber Brevior's 'easy' parts.

	
  * Psalm toned offertory: [PToffertory]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/PToffertory.pdf)

	
  * Mass 17 (the one for Sundays in Advent and Lent

	
  * Credo 1



Theoretically that's enough info for you to look everything up yourself.

If you have a Liber Brevior, then Mass 17 is on p 62, Credo 1 p 66, proper propers p 125, easy propers p [3].

If you have a Liber Usualis, then Mass 17 is on p 60, Credo 1 p 64, proper propers p 334, and the easy propers you can get the hang of because you are smart enough to have your own Liber Usualis!

Libers available from [Fraternity Publications](http://www.fraternitypublications.com/limu.html) or by free download from [Musica Sacra](http://www.musicasacra.com/communion).

Or you can get the propers from [Rene Goupil](http://renegoupil.org) or [the Institute of Christ the King](http://www.institute-christ-king.org/latin-mass-resources/sacred-music/) and the ordinaries from [CC Watershed](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/).

Or I'll put together this booklet with it all in one place:
