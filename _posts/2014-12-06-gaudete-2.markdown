I'm just putting folders together for tomorrow's practice at Lawson Catholic Church 4pm.

[gaudetepropers]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gaudetepropers.pdf) is the Introit, Gradual and Alleluia and Offertory.

The Communion verse is [Dicite Pusillanimes](http://media.musicasacra.com/pdf/dicite.pdf) from Musica Sacra's Communio book.

Two practices, then Mass next Sunday - 3rd Sunday of Advent.

And if you have a spare minute or three [Listen To This](a?"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFtppysEl-k") (nb: this is a Christmas thing, so we won't sing it for Gaudete Sunday at Mass - everyone asks)
