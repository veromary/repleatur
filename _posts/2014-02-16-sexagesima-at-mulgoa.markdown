Sunday 23rd February
practice from 9.30am, Mass from 10.45am

Sheet music for the propers (Introit, Gradual, Tract, Offertory, communion) at [Institute of Christ the King](http://www.institute-christ-king.org/latin-mass-resources/sacred-music/)

**Recordings**

(usually I go by [renegoupil.org](http://renegoupil.org) but that website seems to be down right now, so here are some disparate video clips)
UPDATE: the proper link for [rene goupil](http://ccwatershed.org/goupil/)

Thank you Mary Garner for [this playlist for Sexagesima](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCAdc1vpUtBQvkEX99w1Mi4xYQPeGJWYY)

The ordinary would be Mass 11, though Fr said he'd be fine if we sang Byrd's Mass for five voices.  Good to have that as a back up.

I'm inclined to psalm tone the tract but see how we go.
