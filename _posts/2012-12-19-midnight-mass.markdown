Midnight Mass at St Mary's Mulgoa 2012.

Looks like we're going with [Last Year's Plans](http://hymni.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/christmas-2011/).

And from Benjamin Bloomfield's excellent [Collection of Christmas Carols](https://code.google.com/p/collectionchristmascarols/) here's 
[AdesteFideles]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AdesteFideles.pdf) modified to match the lyrics in our booklets (only had to insert one verse).  Adeste Fideles is a bit tricky as the rhythm is variable, so having the music like this helps line up what syllable goes with which note.

I might have the chance to do the rest of the music like that - also good for anyone who would like to sing parts.
