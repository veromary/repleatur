Being able to sing great Traditional Catholic music is one of the highlights of camp. Masses are roughly half Novus Ordo Masses, half Latin Masses, and both often have a mix of English and Latin music.

And in case it helps, here is the [Easter Camp Booklet](https://github.com/veromary/Congregavit/raw/master/eastercamp.pdf).

Any special requests, ideas, email: [veronica@brandt.id.au](mailto:veronica@brandt.id.au)

For the keen beans.
