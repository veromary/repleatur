Being able to sing great Traditional Catholic music is one of the highlights of camp. Masses are roughly half Novus Ordo Masses, half Latin Masses, and both often have a mix of English and Latin music.

And in case it helps, here is the [Easter Camp Booklet](https://github.com/veromary/Congregavit/raw/master/eastercamp.pdf).

Any special requests, ideas, email: [veronica@brandt.id.au](mailto:veronica@brandt.id.au)

For the keen beans.

## Sheet Music for the Retreat:

### Rounds

Alleluia Round or Canon by William Boyce [Printable PDF 1 page](http://www0.cpdl.org/wiki/images/0/06/So_alleluiab.pdf)

* [Video from Uruguay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-kAL48B1_4)

Fr Popplewell's Tantum Ergo from 2017 [Printable PDF 1 page]({{ site.url }}/pdf/motets/tantumergo-dp.pdf)

* Anyone have a recording of this one?

Non nobis Domine - a round in 3 parts - nice as a finale "Not unto us, Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy Name be the glory" [Printable PDF 1 page](http://stcpress.org/miscellaneous/non_nobis_domine/non_nobis_domine.pdf)

* Lots of recordings of this one available - [This one is alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdLPAOXTbMc)


### Other pieces

The Very Impressive Regina Caeli by Gregor Aichinger [Printable PDF 2 pages](http://www0.cpdl.org/wiki/images/5/5c/Ws-aich-re1.pdf) 

* see [a video of little choir in a lovely old church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-rDcNUo3k) or 
* [this longer video for people who like wild geese and long organ improvisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TAdk_JfCzM)

The Propers for any Latin Masses [Printable PDF about 6 pages](http://www.institute-christ-king.org/uploads/music/Mass2SAE_lg.pdf) - includes Entrance Antiphon, Alleluia, Offertory Antiphon and Communion Antiphon.

* I have to make a video of these for my choir at Lawson - this would be probably not for many people, and I'll bring easy versions too as backup.

Missa Lux Origo - Mass 1 - the Gregorian setting for Easter: [Printable PDF about 5 pages](http://www.ccwatershed.org/pdfs/djc_01_complete_pdf/download/)

* I thought I'd done a video for this, but I haven't, so another for the list.

Mass in Re - I have to dig this one up - this was the two part Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus and Agnus Dei which we used quite a bit last year. Fr Laurence Bevenot died in 1990, so this work is still in copyright so I can't share it here. You can purchase copies at [Presto Classical](https://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/sheet-music/composers/35125--bevenot-laurence). I've placed an order so after camp I'll hopefully have a better idea which editions are best to buy. Postage is $6.50 for the first piece and $3.30 for each additional piece.

See you there!
