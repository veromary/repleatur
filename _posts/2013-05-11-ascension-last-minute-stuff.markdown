Here's the booklet for the congregation:
[pewsheet](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pewsheet.pdf)

And I went and changed the words for O Sanctissima to fit the [St Gregory Hymnal](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23673/23673-h/images/N206_P318.gif) version - two part SA, four verses instead of our former five.  Also public domain so I'll put this into the file for the Accompaniment Edition of the Mass Book.  (one week to go and the [fundraising](http://brandt.id.au) is about the half way mark!)

Come Holy Ghost!
