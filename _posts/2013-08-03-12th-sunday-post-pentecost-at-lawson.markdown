So, Sunday the 11th August 2013, I will be coming straight from a breastfeeding conference in Arcadia, so may be late for Mass, so here are the propers in the simplest possible configuration:

Here is the Introit:
[maina11485]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/maina11485.pdf)

This one is the Gradual and Alleluia put together:
[maina12972]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/maina12972.pdf)

This one is the Gradual, Offertory and Communion:
[gregorio51fc833f032af8.92640586]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gregorio51fc833f032af8.92640586.pdf)

I have made seven copies to go in the black folders.

I'm not sure if I'll make the pewbooks - we probably don't really need them.
