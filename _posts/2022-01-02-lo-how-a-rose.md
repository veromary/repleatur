title: Lo, How a Rose 
---

Happy Holy Name of Jesus!

I've been hoping to sing Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming this Christmas season. This morning we had a bit of a practice, but [my earlier version](/pdf/motets/lohowarose.pdf) isn't so clear for the Alto and Tenor voices, as they have some syncopation to fit words around.

So I found [this one from CPDL](https://cpdl.org/wiki/images/c/cd/Praetorius_einros.pdf) with Lilypond source and happily edited the text to match the English version in our hymnbooks.

And [Here Is My New Version](/pdf/motets/Praetorius_einros.pdf).

We're also aiming to sing [Jesu Rex Admirabilis](https://www.ccwatershed.org/2015/09/09/sab-setting-palestrina-jesu-rex-admirabilis/).
