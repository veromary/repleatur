title: Lo, How a Rose 
---

Happy Holy Name of Jesus!

I've been hoping to sing Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming this Christmas season. This morning we had a bit of a practice, but [my earlier version](/pdf/motets/lohowarose.pdf) isn't so clear for the Alto and Tenor voices, as they have some syncopation to fit words around.

So I found [this one from CPDL](https://cpdl.org/wiki/images/c/cd/Praetorius_einros.pdf) with Lilypond source and happily edited the text to match the English version in our hymnbooks.

And [Here Is My New Version](/pdf/motets/Praetorius_einros.pdf).

We're also aiming to sing [Jesu Rex Admirabilis](https://www.ccwatershed.org/2015/09/09/sab-setting-palestrina-jesu-rex-admirabilis/).

**UPDATE:** Singing Jesu Rex Admirabilis went really well today, but Lo How a Rose was a bit shaky, so I'm saving it for next Sunday's Sung Mass.

Being a Sung Mass, I needed to put it in Latin, so :

[Here is the Latin: Flos de Rad√≠ce Jesse](/pdf/motets/Praetorius_flos.pdf)

Here is my instructional video for the top melody line:

and here is another choir singing it:

and here's a very nice version in a church:
