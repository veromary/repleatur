We're on for a Sung Mass for Pentecost at Mulgoa this Sunday!

Mass 1, Credo 1

Introit, Sequence and Communion as written.  See [Rene Goupil](http://ccwatershed.org/goupil/), scroll down for Pentecost.

I'd love to sing the sequence in two choirs.  The tune is echoed every second verse.  It's called the Golden Sequence: "It is commonly regarded as one of the greatest masterpieces of sacred Latin poetry ever written." from [Michael Martin's Treasury of Prayers](http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/VSS-2.html).

Alleluia psalm toned as in the [Liber Brevior](http://birettabooks.com/go/webstore/product/liber_brevior/) and I'm not sure what to do with the Offertory - I guess practising it might be a good start.

Veni Creator sung straight chant thing out of the Mass Books after Mass.

Also, first blessings from our new FSSP priest Fr Leung!

The [Liber Brevior](http://birettabooks.com/go/webstore/product/liber_brevior/) is a very handy thing to have if you can get one. It has all the music I've mentioned here and covers all Sundays through the year.  You can download a pdf version from [Musica Sacra's Latin Settings Page](http://musicasacra.com/music/latin-settings/) (scroll down for Liber Brevior 1954).
