[New Plan May-July]({{ site.url }}/pdf/schedules/Lawson2017b.pdf)

and the [earlier plan March-May]({{ site.url }}/pdf/schedules/Lawson2017a.pdf)

and lastly, the plan from Mr Tondys and Mr Nekic [for Mulgoa]({{ site.url }}/pdf/schedules/Mulgoa-2017a.pdf)

Easter was great, with enough variety to be both uplifting and a little exhausting.

Regina Caeli in 4 parts by Aichinger has been a challenging addition to the repertoire.

except, we generally had just 4 singers each time - more exciting that way!
If you like this sort of music and are free on Sunday evenings, come along!
Ability to read music is great, but not essential.

The plan is a guide. The Veni Creator with chant alternating with 4 part harmony is another piece I'd like to do, as well as a certain Panis Angelicus.

So much music! So little time!

God bless you,

Veronica
