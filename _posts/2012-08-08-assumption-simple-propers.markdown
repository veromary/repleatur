Here are the plans for the feast of the Assumption:

[propers](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/propers4.pdf)

[Assump-01](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Assump-01.mp3) Introit - Signum magnum
[Assump-02](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Assump-02.mp3) Gradual - Audi, filia
[Assump-03](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Assump-03.mp3) Alleluia - Assumpta est
[Assump-04](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Assump-04.mp3) Offertory - Inimicitias
[Assump-05](http://repleatur.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Assump-05.mp3) Communion - Beatam me dicent

Ordinaries: [Mass 9](http://antoinedanielmass.org/kyriale/IX/) and [Credo 1](http://www.antoinedanielmass.org/kyriale/Credo/).

This is a Holy Day of Obligation - we don't have many in effect in Australia, so good chance to make the most of it!

Also some of the choir is away, so if you can hold a tune, please turn up early and join in the last minute practice.  Also to decide on the Marian motets and the closing hymn!

We have a hymn for the Assumption in the hymnbooks: [Who is She Ascends So High](http://romaaeterna.jp/romanhmn/rh180.html).  If time permits I'll put up another recording, but that link has a midi file which you should be able to hear.

Another latin hymn in the books is [Virgo Dei Genitrix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hwbKQqQmB8).  And there's always the chance to psalm tone the Magnificat - maybe with the communion antiphon either side?
