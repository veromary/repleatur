Because I thought it was already in here, but couldn't find it.

Sheet music: [IMSLP174387-WIMA.bf36-esca]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMSLP174387-WIMA.bf36-esca.pdf)
Triple tracked recording: [oescaviatorum]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/oescaviatorum.mp3)

Maybe I was too shy to own up to the recording.  If you can find a better, please comment.

English:
O Food of men wayfaring,
the bread of angels sharing,
O Manna from on high!
We hunger; Lord, supply us,
nor thy delights deny us,
whose hearts to thee draw nigh.

O stream of love past telling,
O purest fountain, welling
from out the Savior's side!
We faint with thirst; revive us,
of thine abundance give us,
and all we need provide.

O Jesus, by thee bidden,
we here adore thee, hidden
'neath forms of bread and wine.
Grant when the veil is riven,
we may behold, in heaven,
thy countenance divine.[oremus hymnal](http://www.oremus.org/hymnal/o/o131.html)
