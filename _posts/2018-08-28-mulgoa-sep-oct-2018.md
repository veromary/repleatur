[Here is the schedule for Mulgoa September-October]({{ site.url }}/pdf/schedules/Mulgoa2018SeptOct.pdf)

Lawson continues with Sung Masses on the first and third Sundays of the month.

Parramatta FSSP is working on a new webpage, which will be the logical place for these updates. I will be reconsidering how to best use repleatur.net in the future. Hopefully the November December schedule will have the new FSSP webpage.

You can find [Parramatta Latin Mass Chaplaincy on Facebook!](https://www.facebook.com/ParraFSSP/)

God bless you and keep you!
