Next Sung Mass at Mulgoa is on [Sunday 15th July]({{ site.url }}/events/seventh-sunday-post-pentecost/).  Omnes gentes plaudite manibus!  All nations clap yo' hands!

![Wolf in sheep's clothing](http://hystar.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/wold-sheep-clothing2.jpg)Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. By their fruits you shall know them.

Mass 11, Credo 1.

Go check the introit and communion at [Rene Goupil](http://renegoupil.org).  And the Alleluia part of the Alleluia.

I'll still try get a booklet together, but being waylaid by revising the Hymnbooks.  School holidays!
