### 20 March, 3rd Sunday of Lent

* May this Lenten Discipline: [Video from awesome Mass in Sydney with Cardinal Burke](https://youtu.be/kus0_eCOxSA?t=162), Google "May this Lenten discipline,
which we undertake with love,
turn our minds to things above." for the lyrics and music - they are copyright, but appear in different pdf booklets and are very consistent as it's a recent composition. Australian too.
* Audi Benigne Conditor: [Clear video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN-UBu8a8TE), [here's the link to gregobase](https://gregobase.selapa.net/chant.php?id=1830) - *UPDATE* - [**sheet music: audiben.pdf**](/pdf/chant/audiben.pdf)
* Soul of my Saviour: you have to learn this off by heart, but here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdFNZfGpSs) - [PDF](/pdf/organ/Soul-choir.pdf)
* Forty Days and Forty Nights again

### 27 March, 4th Sunday of Lent, Laetare

* Mass 17
* Credo 1
* Jesu Rex Admirabilis: [Alternating with chant - mp3 and pdf](https://www.ccwatershed.org/2015/09/09/sab-setting-palestrina-jesu-rex-admirabilis/)
* Ave Verum: [New Book Old Hymns](https://newbookoldhymns.brandt.id.au/hymns/aveverum.html)
* Come to Me all Ye Who Labour: [words](https://aash.org/about-aash/sacred-heart-traditions/come-to-me) - it seems to be less common than I thought. [Here's a quick video I've made for it](https://youtu.be/F_jwGKv0vjI)

There's also a hymn by Christian Catsanos and Tate Pumfrey especially for Laetare Sunday. If Come to Me is too tricky, we could try their hymn.

Phew! That took longer than I expected!
