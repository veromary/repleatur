Change of plan for this Sunday's music at Lawson.

2nd Sunday of Advent
9th December 2012

Mass 11, Credo 1, psalm toned propers from [Rene Goupil](http://renegoupil.org) (Mode 2) and [Veni Veni Emmanuel](http://liberreader.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/veni-veni-emmanuel/).

Easy peasy.

The reason : we haven't been able to get together for any practice - so 4pm before Mass starts at 5pm is all we have.
