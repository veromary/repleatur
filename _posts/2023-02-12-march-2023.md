Lots of God of Mercy and Compassion for Lent.

### 2nd Sunday of Lent

**5 March 2023** - Low Mass

* The Glory of these Forty Days
* Parce Domine
* Draw nigh and take
* God of Mercy and Compassion

### 3rd Sunday of Lent

**12 March 2023** - Low Mass

* O Gracious Maker Bend thine Ears - we had some positive feedback about this one and thought maybe this time we go with the Tallis Canon as in the Living Parish Hymnal
* Attende Domine
* Adoro Te
* Lord Jesus, think on me

### 4th Sunday of Lent (Laetare)

**19 March 2023** - Sung Mass - change of plan.

* Mass XVII
* Audi Benigne Conditor
* Come to me all ye who labour
* God of Mercy and Compassion

### Passion Sunday

**26 March 2023** - Sung Mass

* Mass XVII
* Credo VI
