Introducing Monica Sabine Brandt!

This Sunday is the second Sunday of the month, so time for a sung Mass at Lawson!

The propers are for the 21st Sunday after Pentecost - the Offertory text is awesome.

Corpus Christi Watershed has [this plan.](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2016/oct/7/musical-resources-21st-sunday-after-pentecost/)  We'll do the Introit and Communion something like that, plus Missa Orbis Factor (Mass 11) and maybe some Marian hymns.

There's that [3 part O Sanctissima based on the harmonisation by Beethoven]({{ site.url }}/pdf/motets/O_sanctissima.pdf).

Ave Vera Virginitas would be fantastic, but I think we're short of voices and time.

Practice from **3.30pm** in the meeting room at Our Lady of the Nativity Catholic Church, GWH, Lawson.
