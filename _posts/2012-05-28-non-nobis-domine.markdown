Dreaming about three part motets again.  Non nobis Domine is a round with the twist that the second part is transposed (a fourth below).

The translation is "Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but to Thy name be the glory".

[CPDL](http://www.cpdl.org) has a page: [Non nobis Domine (Anonymous)](http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Non_nobis_Domine_(Anonymous)) with many scores - I like the one page version by Aaron Elkiss(CPDL #17430).  Also a great description of where the canon came from.  And thanks to [CHGiffen](http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Charles_H._Giffen) for pointing it out.

And for a video clip [a small choir's rendition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiE76gW850g) maybe while on holidays going by the dress - they must have been on their way to a Spanish beach and went to pay a visit to the Cathedral on the way.  If they can do it, so can we!
