Offertory:[![alleluia]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/alleluia-300x163.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1IoWqxxJ7U)

[Concordi Laetitiae](http://youtu.be/GDNGr76hRU0) from the Parish Book of Chant organ accompaniment.

Communion motet:

[O Filii et Filiae](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYCyO5eVQmQ) being sung as a Communion motet in Ottawa.

And if you have time, here's [O Filii at St Mary's Cathedral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gdfiOkQwgE), very spiffy.  Slightly different tune to our version, but great organ, descants, the works.
