title: From practice at Lawson

We had a great practice today with extra accompaniment on the little organ.

###Ordinaries

The first things to learn are the ordinary parts of the Mass.

[Here is a one page sheet in modern notation of the sung responses](http://www.ccwatershed.org/pdfs/5621-responses-traditional-latin-mass/download/)

Then, you can find the Asperges, Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, Agnus Dei and Credo [here at St Antoine Daniel Kyriale](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/) 

1. Asperges is at the top of the page.
2. Next scroll down to Mass XI Orbis Factor and you have Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus and Agnus Dei.
3. Lastly, scroll down further to Credo I.

If you've got all that you are doing well!  Ideally everyone in the congregation would be singing all those parts.  Go to [Maternal Heart, Lewisham](http://www.maternalheart.org) to see this in action.  We do have a fairly good number singing along at Lawson/Wentworth Falls though, but Maternal Heart is always worth a visit.

###Propers
