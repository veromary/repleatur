[propers]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/propers1.pdf)

For the introit see [ccwatershed's great looking page](http://www.ccwatershed.org/pdfs/8567-introit-spiritus-domini-replevit-orbem-terrarum-alleluja-et-hoc-quod-continet/download/).

For the basics see the [earlier post]({{ site.url }}/2012/05/08/pentecost-preparations/) with lots of youtube clips.  That is, Mass 1, Credo 1, Veni Sancte Spiritus, Veni Creator.  Learn those first.

Then the proper introit and communion.  In Paschaltide we get two Alleluias, each with their own tune, but for this Mass I've made the short cut of using one tune for both verses - they fit together sort of like a double versed Alleluia.

That leaves the offertory which is set to a psalm tone.

So that's the plan to this minute.  There's plenty to run through so let's try be there by 10am on Sunday.
