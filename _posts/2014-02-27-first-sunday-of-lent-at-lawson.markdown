![jesusindesert]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jesusindesert.jpg)If we're keeping on going with the existing plan for a sung Mass once a month at Lawson, next Sunday will be a practice for the first Sunday of Lent.

This may sound crazy, but I think we can try the propers.  The ones in the Liber.

Go hear them sung well: [ccwatershed.org/goupil](http://ccwatershed.org/goupil)

We'll probably still psalm tone the gradual and tract.  [Here it is.  Yes, it's a bit loooong.]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gregorio530ef1e6812a56.66252371.pdf) (not as long as last Sunday's Epistle)

I'm trying to teach them to my family.  We don't have to have everyone sing them.  I think it would be worth it.

Notice the words of the offertory and communion are almost identical, which argues for doing the proper chant - otherwise they will sound exactly the same.

Update: Here's the plan sung by my son and me:
