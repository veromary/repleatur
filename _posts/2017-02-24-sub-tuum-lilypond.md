I've spent a morning typing up the organ accompaniment for the Marian Antiphon.

[SubTuum-monastic.pdf]({{ site.url }}/pdf/organ/SubTuum-monastic.pdf)

I started by typing up [SubTuum-roman.pdf]({{ site.url }}/pdf/organ/SubTuum-roman.pdf)

Lilypond is not really made for this sort of music.  You simulate the lack of Meter by having bars for every beat, then hide the bar lines.

Also, in my earlier transcriptions I used slurs where I should have used ties.  Learning all the time.

One of the best parts about typing it up is that you can transpose for those who might prefer to play with one sharp rather than four flats.

Now, to get back to making a CD for choir home study for the upcoming Masses.
