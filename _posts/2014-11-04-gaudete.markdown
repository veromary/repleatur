The rose coloured vestments are due for Sunday 14th December.

Sung Mass at Our Lady of the Nativity Church, Lawson.

Here are my favourite bits:

Practice from 4pm in the parish meeting room, Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament about 4.30pm in the Church with Benediction about 4.50pm.  Mass starts 5pm, expected to finish just a little after 6pm.
