### 1 Oct: 18th Sunday after Pentecost

* Low Mass:
* Thee, O Christ, the Prince of Ages
* [Da pacem Domine](https://newbookoldhymns.brandt.id.au/hymns/dapacem.html) - chant or round depending on how we're going
* Anima Christi
* Virgin wholly marvellous

### 8 Oct: 19th Sunday after Pentecost

* Sung Mass: 
* [Ave Maria](https://newbookoldhymns.brandt.id.au/hymns/avemaria.html)
* We Stand for God

### 15 Oct: 20th Sunday after Pentecost

* Low Mass, plus Supper after Mass
* Firmly I Believe
* [By the Waters of Babylon][2] - I'm not sure about this one, whether it's now a pop song as it was on a famous album in 1978 - though the sheet music at this link is a little different to the pop version. A more authentic [video here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RSWMFxloAHo). But at least we're NOT doing [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3QxT-w3WMo)
* O Bread of Heaven
* O Purest of Creatures

### 22 Oct: 21st Sunday after Pentecost

This one has the really long Offertory antiphon about Job. So I don't think we'll have time left for an Offertory Motet. Feel free to suggest any short things.

* Sung Mass
* Hail Queen of Heaven

### 29 Oct: Christ the King!

* Hail Redeemer
* Christus Vincit
* Lauda Jerusalem - like on the pilgrimage [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aalgBkxZmGU), [sheet music from CPDL][1], another [short video from the closing Mass at Ballarat last year](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkVMfkKvUL1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) - you might be able to hear me singing in there if you can hear anything over the organ - not sure if we can manage quite the same organ levels, but 4 part harmony would be great. Also, [one more video from Dakar, Senegal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUBaEu3J6eQ)
* Crown Him with Many Crowns
