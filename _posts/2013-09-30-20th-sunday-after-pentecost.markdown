So, we're having a go at a simple Sung Mass at Mulgoa.

This is for next Sunday.

The ordinary (Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, Agnus Dei) will be from Missa Orbis Factor or Mass Eleven.  You can find materials for these parts over at [St Antoine Daniel Gregorian Chant Kyriale](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/).  Scroll down to **Mass XI â€¢ Orbis factor** and you'll find the links.

The Credo will be Credo I, which can be found a little further down the same page.

Here is the sheet music for the propers: [gregorio5246a667cb1686.40466635]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gregorio5246a667cb1686.40466635.pdf)

**Introit**

This is divided up into :


  1. The Antiphon (Omnia quae fecisti ... misericordiae tuae.)


  2. The Verse (Ps. Beati immaculati ... lege Domini.)


  3. The Doxology (Gloria Patri ... Amen.)




We usually sing this in this order : 1, 2, 3, 1.  But if we need more time we will sing it 1, 2, 1, 3, 1.

Here is a recording with my mother, Teresa, leading and me joining in where the rest of the choir usually joins in.  We're singing 1231.

**Gradual**

This is sung just after the Epistle

**Alleluia**

Straight after the Gradual comes the Alleluia.

Let's divide this one up too:



  1. Leader starts Alleluia


  2. Everyone repeats Alleluia


  3. Everyone continues the Jubilus - the fancy bit continuing the last syllable of the Alleluia


  4. Leader starts the verse


  5. Everyone joins in the end of the verse


  6. Everyone goes back to the beginning and sings the alleluia and jubilus through to finish.

That's all the tricky stuff done

**Offertory**

The leader sings, then the rest join in at the star.

**Communion**

Same pattern again - leader starts, we join in at the star.

And that's it for the propers!

God bless, let me know how you go, and hope to see you there by 10 Sunday morning at Mulgoa.  A practice on Saturday would be great - join the [Mailing List]({{ site.url }}/mailman/listinfo/choir_repleatur.net) to discuss it.

UPDATE: I nearly forgot.  There was the suggestion to make the recordings available in a male voice, which has been unsuccessful, but here is the Communion verse taken down an octave thanks to audio editing software:
