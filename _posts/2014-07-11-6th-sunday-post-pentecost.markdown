Looks like we're on for a Sung Mass on Sunday 20th of July at Lawson, 5pm.

The propers are almost all familiar to me - I can remember banging the notes into my head.

See what you think - [Rene Goupil, scroll down to 6th after Pentecost](http://www.ccwatershed.org/goupil) and check out the Videos.

If we can manage the proper Communion Antiphon, then there are extra verses available at [Communio](http://musicasacra.com/communio/) - click on Circuibo.  The Gloria Patri tones there look useful too.

And if any Mulgoa people think that double heading sung Masses on Sunday is a good thing, then that might be the way to go.

**Update:** [Here is a psalm toned Gradual and Alleluia.]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregorio53c0e7f6c97066.96111080.pdf)
