We had a good practice today.  The traffic was awful coming down from Katoomba so not everyone could make it.  For anyone who would still like to join in next week I'll list absolutely everything here.  I have a spare CD of the propers for anyone with difficulty listening to mp3s.  The rest is just like last month, so should be good for our regular choir members.

Choir practice next Sunday will be at 3.30pm at St Francis Xavier's Church, Wentworth Falls.

For the 7th Sunday after Pentecost:
