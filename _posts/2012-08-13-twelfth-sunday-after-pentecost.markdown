(Twas the day before th'Assumption and hopefully everyone can run through Mass 9 ready for tomorrow.)

This Sunday is the 3rd Sunday of the month so supposed to be a sung Mass at Mulgoa.
[propers]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/propers6.pdf)

Mass 11, Credo 1 as usual.  Maybe Adoro te at Communion if time permits.
