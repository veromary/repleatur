Quick transcription of the Psalm toned Propers of the Gregorian Institute of Guam.

[propers.pdf]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/propers2.pdf)

Hooray for the GABC Transcription Tool!

Mass 11, Credo 1, still to decide which motets - Ubi Caritas and Adoro te went well today so they top the list.

And Sung Mass this Wednesday 7pm Mulgoa for the feast of St Mary of the Cross.  Mass 9, Credo 1, mixed propers, to be typed tonight!
