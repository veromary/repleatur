[Le Barroux Chant](http://barrouxchant.com/)
[The Monks of Norcia](http://osbnorcia.org/blog)
Catching up on [Fr Z](http://wdtprs.com) posts I came across this [Just Too Cool: Options for Divine Office sung in Gregorian chant â€“ ONLINE](http://wdtprs.com/blog/2012/07/just-too-cool-options-for-divine-office-sung-in-gregorian-chant-online/).

The problem with being in Australia is we're ahead of the rest (except NZ) so these generally give yesterday's chant, but still plenty here to listen to.

But I will get on to recordings for this Sunday's simplified propers.  Just after we sing Prime, have breakfast, try get some schoolwork done, argh, then there's an [ABA](http://breastfeeding.asn.au) meeting, and then get home - so then make recordings.  Unless substitute making recordings for morning schoolwork...
