I'll leave this up in case it helps anyone else preparing for Divine Mercy Sunday, but our choir has swapped for a prine-time Easter Sunday Mass!  I can't remember the exact time but I think it was 10.30am.

I'll start a new post and the rest is old news now.

Also known as Quasimodo Sunday, Dominica in Albis, First Sunday after Easter and now Divine Mercy Sunday - we're singing it!

**Introit:** Quasi modo - crave as newborn babes pure spiritual milk
If you have 99c to spare, you might like the 22nd track on [this album, Graduale Project: Year One](http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/marekklein).  You can listen to it [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26JhFgFbLFo).
(there are two Alleluias - what do you reckon?  should we tackle one? Or both even?)
**Offertory:** Angelus Domini [here on youtube sung by a ladies choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg_bYZxFIFc) - way up high in the sky.
**Communio:** Mitte manum tuam [here sung by a solo Polish man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR9xJcMNvOo) - nice pitch for us.


Or there are the old dependable sources of recordings:

  * Crown Him with many crowns

  * [Jubilate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpzyi5nMJnc)
