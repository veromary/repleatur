Well, it's May already.

We had an unplanned Covid experience at the end of April and now we're back. We just happened to get Covid about the same time as Fr Gilbride. The Last Sunday Mass in April was cancelled.

### 1 May: St Joseph the Worker

So, the first Sunday of May was 1st May, the feast of St Joseph the Worker and we had a Low Mass.

* Hail Redeemer
