title: June's Sung Mass at Wentworth Falls
---

The next Sung Mass for the Lawson Schola is Sunday 14th June at St Francis Xavier's Church, Wentworth Falls, 5pm.

Choir practice has been moved forward half an hour but still in the same meeting room at **Lawson**.  So 3.30pm-4.30 at Lawson, allowing a little time to travel up to Wentworth Falls for those attending Mass at 5pm.

Here are some more things for the choir:

 * Cor Jesu Sacratissimum - a short antiphon with a couple of psalm verses to pad it out - [PDF to print]({{ site.url }}/pdf/corjesusacratissimum.pdf) and [Audio MP3]({{ site.url }}/audio/corjesu88.mp3)
 * Psalm toned Gradual and Alleluia - [PDF to print]({{ site.url }}/pdf/3pentecostgradalle.pdf) and [Audio MP3]({{ site.url }}/audio/pente03gradalle.mp3)
 * Psalm toned Offertory antiphon - [PDF to print]({{ site.url }}/pdf/3pentecostoffertory.pdf) and [Audio MP3]({{ site.url }}/audio/pente03off.mp3)

I'm still hoping to have a go at [the three part motet I posted earlier]({{ site.url }}/2015/05/31/sacred-heart-motet/) but there's always Ave Verum to fall back on.

I'm planning Mass XI (Orbis Factor) and Credo 1.

See you this Sunday for practice at 3.30pm at Lawson!
