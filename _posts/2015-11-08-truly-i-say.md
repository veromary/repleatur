Hopefully I can have the current bulletin available [here](http://repleatur.net/bulletins/parrafssp.pdf) for those who would like to keep in touch but can't pick up a bulletin at Mass for whatever reason.  Read on for the next Sung Mass - Sunday 13th December and early plans for Christmas.  You can [subscribe by email](https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=Repleatur&loc=en_US) if you'd like an email whenever I publish a new post here (about once a week).

### Bulletins!

Mrs Gaweda is kindly forwarding on the bulletin to me and it is available to download [parrafssp.pdf](http://repleatur.net/bulletins/parrafssp.pdf)

My plan is to upload to that same address each week, so bookmark it and hope I can keep it up!

Here's a highlight from the [Bulletin](http://repleatur.net/bulletins/parrafssp.pdf):

> Family picnic day at Mt SchÓ§nstatt
>
> Next Saturday ~~14th November.~~ **postponed due to rain to 28th November**
> Beginning at 11 am with Holy Mass at St Mary's Catholic Church 1262 Mulgoa Rd, Mulgoa.
> After Mass is a picnic followed by a talk and Rosary.
> There will opportunity for Confession (e.g. During the Rosary.)
> After the Rosary we will go to the lookout over the Nepean River.
> If interested, please contact Fr Klein.

And before going on, I'd like to share a favourite tune from the Communion Antiphon for Mass for the last Sundays before Advent: [Amen Dico Vobis]({{ site.url }}/audio/pente23/amendicovobis.mp3) Amen, I say to you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and you will have it.

## Gaudete!

The next sung Mass is planned for the Third Sunday of Advent, **Sunday 13th December**, also known as *Gaudete Sunday*. The name comes from the introit: Gaudete in Domino semper - Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say rejoice!

We'll stay with Mass 8, Credo 3 through Christmas.

The Propers:

* Introit - Gaudete [me singing a bit too high mp3]({{ site.url }}/audio/gaudete/introitus.mp3) * [monks singing mp3](http://www.ccwatershed.org/audio/9326-gaudete-free-mp3/download/) * [pdf](http://www.ccwatershed.org/pdfs/dcef_int_3rd_sun_advent/download/)
* Gradual - we'll psalm tone this one
* Alleluia - an easy one [mp3]({{ site.url }}/audio/gaudete/alleluia.mp3)
* Offertory - Benedixisti - might psalm tone this one too, or [monks singing mp3](http://www.ccwatershed.org/audio/9309-benedixisti-domine-terram-tuam-offertory/download/)
* Communio - Dicite pusillanimes [mp3]({{ site.url }}/audio/gaudete/communio.mp3) * [monks singing mp3](http://www.ccwatershed.org/audio/9306-dicite-pusillanimes-communion-mp3/download/) * [pdf](http://www.ccwatershed.org/pdfs/dcef_com_3rd_sun_advent/download/)

You can find the psalm toned bits in [this booklet from last year]({{ site.url }}/pdf/gaudete/propers2.pdf).  It uses the Ordinary for Advent and Lent - which is one of the easiest ones to learn, but as Gaudete is sort of an upbeat Advent Sunday we can go with Missa de Angelis - plus it's better known and good to practice for Christmas.

Practice Sunday 6th December (St Nicholas Day with probably a special appearance from St Nicholas himself!) and the day of the sung Mass: Sunday 13th December.

### Extra pieces

There is a Christmas Carol called Gaudete, but it's not so good for Advent.

There are heaps of fantastic Advent hymns:

* Rorate Caeli
* Conditor Alme Siderum
* Alma Redemptoris Mater

Veni veni Emmanuel starts on Dec 17 or thereabouts, for the O Antiphons - but it can be for earlier in Advent if it helps. [Here it is sung by my mother, Patrick and me]({{ site.url }}/audio/veniosapientia140922.mp3)

Those are all in [a New Book of Old Hymns](http://www.brandt.id.au/newbookoldhyms/). And [here are some recordings/videos](http://newbookoldhymns.tumblr.com/tagged/advent)

### Plans for Christmas

So far the plan is Midnight Mass at Mulgoa, then a day Mass at Wentworth Falls.

I think we can sing both - Christmas comes but once a year.  I don't expect everyone to sing both, but if you can let me know your plans then I can work around that.
