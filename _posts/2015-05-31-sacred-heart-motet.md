Here it is, the easy 3 part motet written by Australian priest, Fr Tom Luby M.S.C.

[AmeturChoir.pdf]({{ site.url }}/pdf/AmeturChoir.pdf)

More about it [in this post on the Musica Sacra Forum](http://forum.musicasacra.com/forum/discussion/621/simple-motet-for-the-sacred-heart/p1)

For your practice purposes I have painstakingly prepared a plethora of mp3s:

 * [where the soprano line dominates]({{ site.url }}/audio/ametursop.mp3)
 * [where the alto line dominates]({{ site.url }}/audio/ameturalto.mp3)
 * [where the bass line dominates]({{ site.url }}/audio/ameturbass.mp3)

Thank you Hugh Henry, for sharing the music.

Thank you Patrick for your help in making these recordings.

### The 14th June

This is in readiness for the next Sung Mass at Lawson - or more likely Wentworth Falls at this stage.

The propers are available in mp3 format [at Rene Goupil](http://www.ccwatershed.org/goupil) Scroll down to the 3rd Sunday after Pentecost and look for the Introit starting with Respice.

The Alleluia is a doozy, but see how we go.

See you on Sunday 7th June!
