June is drawing to a close, with the feast of Sts Peter and Paul.

July opens with the feast of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ on Sunday. This will also be Fr Klein's last Mass at Mulgoa before he leaves for his new appointment in Germany.

Lawson continues with Sung Masses on the first and third Sundays of the month.

God bless you and keep you!
