A simple sung Mass.  No sprinkling on the night, starting straight with the introit and could have used a few extra verses to help keep the music going till after Fr says the Kyrie (we sang through the Kyrie then said it with the priest - should be able to time it better, but not a serious problem)

Using Missa Orbis Factor because we know two masses so far: 8 and 11.
Fr Eugene hanging in there despite being two days away from a much needed hip operation.  Pray for his recovery!

Next sung Mass - the Sunday in the octave of Corpus Christi.
