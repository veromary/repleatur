Hi everyone!

If we go with the plan to have the second Sunday in September as a Sung Mass in Mulgoa and Lawson, we hit the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.

Some of you would be familiar with the music from the annual Christus Rex pilgrimage which celebrates the votive Mass of the Holy Cross on the Friday of the pilgrimage.

The music is awesome and well worth learning as much as possible.

Here is the link to Hugh Henry's practice recordings from the pilgrimage:

Don't worry about the motets.  If we can do Mass 4 and the propers that would be wonderful.

Veronica
