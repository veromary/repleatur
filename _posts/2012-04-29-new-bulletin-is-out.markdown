The new bulletin for May/June is out for the Parramatta FSSP!

Highlights (aka First Class Feasts) include:



	
  * This Wednesday: St Joseph the Worker: Mass 7am Girraween

	
  * Ascension Thursday: Masses at 7am Girraween, 7pm Mulgoa

	
  * Our Lady Help of Christians: 7am Girraween, 7pm Mulgoa

	
  * Pentecost Sunday: usual Sunday Masses

	
  * Corpus Christi: 7am Girraween, 7pm Mulgoa

	
  * Sacred Heart: 7am Girraween, 7pm Mulgoa


All the first Saturday Singing practices at Girraween are also listed in red!

Also a possible procession listed for the 2nd Sunday after Pentecost - I guess that would be the Corpus Christi procession transferred.

Lawson sung Masses are not specified, but still planned for 13 May and 10 June. Fr Eugene's hip operation is scheduled for 15 May, so please keep him in your prayers.

And also prayers for the regional meeting 7-9 May.

If you get this post via email, that's great! If you could let me know, that's good too. We're down a choir member for three weeks so more reason to recruit new people.  I'll try keep the Events Listing up to date, but you can always email me for any clarifications.  Theoretically you should be able to log in and I can set up permissions so lots of people can help keep this webpage up to date, but might take a while to get the hang of that.
