Three Sung Masses this month.

I've set myself a bit of a high bar with linking to sheet music, so I might not be able to have everything ready all at once, but it's a first step to put up the skeleton and keep building.

### 3 April: Passion Sunday

Low Mass

* When I survey the wondrous Cross - [**sheet music: WhenISurvey.pdf**](/pdf/hymns/WhenISurvey.pdf)
* Vexilla Regis - [**sheet music: vexilla.pdf**](/pdf/chant/vexilla.pdf)
* Ave Verum - [A New Book of Old Hymns](https://newbookoldhymns.brandt.id.au/hymns/aveverum.html)
* Abroad the regal banners - [**sheet music: abroad.pdf**](/pdf/chant/abroad.pdf)

### 10 April: Palm Sunday

* Mass 17
* Credo 1
* Popule Meus - Victoria - or the chant one if we're out of singers.
* O Sacred Head - [Vatican Hymnal Page](https://archive.ccwatershed.org/media/pdfs/11/08/17/19-15-54_0.pdf) - about half the words are the same - I'm sorry, I loved the verse which called Jesus our Friend, but if you get the hang of the tune, I'll aim to have a copy with our words and this harmony together before the beginning of April!

### 17 April: Easter Sunday

* Mass 1
* Credo 1
* O Filii et Filiae
* Alleluia, sing to Jesus

### 24 April: Low Sunday

* Mass 1
* Credo 1
* Alleluia, canon by William Boyce
* Through the Red Sea
