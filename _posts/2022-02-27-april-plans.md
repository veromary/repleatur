Three Sung Masses this month.

I've set myself a bit of a high bar with linking to sheet music, so I might not be able to have everything ready all at once, but it's a first step to put up the skeleton and keep building.

### 3 April: Passion Sunday

Low Mass - End of Daylight Savings!

* God of Mercy and Compassion again - [PDF](/pdf/hymns/GodofMercy.pdf)
* Vexilla Regis - [**sheet music: vexilla.pdf**](/pdf/chant/vexilla.pdf)
* Ave Verum - [A New Book of Old Hymns](https://newbookoldhymns.brandt.id.au/hymns/aveverum.html)
* Abroad the regal banners - [**sheet music: abroad.pdf**](/pdf/chant/abroad.pdf) - or a metrical tune [AbroadTheRegal.pdf](/pdf/hymns/AbroadTheRegal.pdf)

### 10 April: Palm Sunday

* Mass 17
* Credo 1
* Popule Meus - Victoria - or [O Crux Ave](https://www.ccwatershed.org/2017/03/04/o-crux-ave-partial-recording/) by David Friel - I purchased copies some years ago. That link goes to a partial recording for learning the middle part - roughly alto. It's mostly 3 parts for the chorus and splits into 4 for the final. The verses are psalm toned versions of the hymn Vexilla Regis.
* Lord Jesus Think on Me again - [PDF](/pdf/hymns/LordJesusThink.pdf)

### 17 April: Easter Sunday

* Mass 1
* Credo 1
* O Filii et Filiae
* Alleluia, sing to Jesus

### 24 April: Low Sunday

* Mass 1
* Credo 1
* Alleluia, canon by William Boyce
* Through the Red Sea
