I've got Folders for the choir this time.  All the music will be in order in the display books, seven copies.

Here are the propers:

[ILintroit]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ILintroit.pdf)

[ILalleluia]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ILalleluia.pdf)

[ILoffertory]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ILoffertory.pdf)

[ILcommunion]({{ site.url }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ILcommunion.pdf)

All done to psalm tone 2D.  The offertory has some extra flourishes from the solemn version of the psalm tone.

Kyrie from Mass 16, Gloria from Mass 8, Credo 3, Sanctus and Agnus Dei from Mass 18.

Veni Creator Spiritus and Regina Caeli for motets - not sure which for offertory/communion.  Maybe O Jesus Christ Remember for the recessional.
