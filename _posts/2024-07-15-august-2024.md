This year we will not be having a Latin Mass at Lawson for the feast of the Assumption - a Holy Day of Obligation in Australia. The FSSP will be having extra Masses down in Sydney, probably at Girraween.

Also, Veronica is hoping to walk the pilgrimage from Lewisham to North Sydney on 11th August, so that Mass will be a Low Mass. That means there's just one sung Mass planned for August this year.

As always, if you're thinking of joining the choir, we'd love to hear from you. Having a roster of capable choristers means that volunteers can take the occasional Sunday off. Also there is a whole lot more wonderful music we could be singing if we had the voices.

### 4th August - 11th Sunday after Pentecost

* Hail Redeemer
* Veni Creator
* Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all
* O Purest of Creatures

### 11th August - 12th Sunday after Pentecost

This is the day of the pilgrimage from Lewisham to North Sydney where some of the choir are planning to be away for the day, so here is a plan for a Low Mass.

* Come Holy Ghost, Creator come
* Ave verum
* Soul of my Saviour
* Protect us while telling (Lourdes Hymn)

### 18th August - 13th Sunday after Pentecost

* My God accept my heart this day
* Jesu dulcis memoria
* Let all mortal flesh keep silence (Picardy)
* Hail Queen of Heav'n 

### 25th August - 14th Sunday after Pentecost

* Mass 11, Credo 4
* Panis Angelicus (Casciolini/Baini)
* O God of Earth and Altar (Kings Lynn or Aurelia)
